# my-fastai-projects

Projects that I've built while experimenting with the fast.ai library and doing the 2019 fastai deep learning courses.


* Project 1: classifying images of cells on whether or not the cell is infected or parasitised [notebook](https://github.com/StephenPritchard/my-fastai-projects/blob/master/malaria-infection-classification.ipynb) 
* Project 2: classifying images of fruit (120 different types) [notebook](https://github.com/StephenPritchard/my-fastai-projects/blob/master/fruit-classification.ipynb)
